# TEDx Talks API
I saw a video by Sean Gourley on [data visualisation extracted from TEDxTalks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv_uyUTx5Po) which facinated me. This spured me to look for a TEDxTalks API on the web but to no avail. I am on a journey to create my own version of the API, using the RSS feed [here](https://pa.tedcdn.com/feeds/talks.rss) suggested by [Michell Bak](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7239836/ted-talk-api-or-workaround-for-data-access). I have also found there's an unofficial API from [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/bestApi/api/ted) which is a free API service up to 100 requests/ mth which isn't much. 

I have little to no experience building APIs but I am interested to know how it works and what I can do with it. I will probably build it on REST but in the future I might extend it to GraphQL.

### Disclaimer

I know the RSS feed only provides some TEDxTalks articles/videos which is far from Sean Gourley's entire archive, but if I can build an API serving this small amount of data, I can always find other sources to scrape data from to get more datasets.
